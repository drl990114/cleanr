# cleanr-plugin-api

Shared declarations for cleanr's data-only plugin system: manifests,
capabilities, deterministic discovery, trust levels, and load diagnostics.

Plugins are declarative bundles and never load native or WebAssembly code. A
bundle contains a `plugin.toml` manifest plus `rules/*.toml` and/or
`locales/*.yml`. Discovery order is deterministic, duplicate IDs are rejected,
and invalid bundles are reported without aborting application startup.
