description: Understand why Cleanr marks a path, how confidence affects selection, and what built-in rules cover.
---

# Rules and confidence

Cleanr does not decide that a path is removable from its name alone. It matches
scanned entries against versioned **rule packs** that explain what the item is,
why it can be removed, and what rebuilding it may cost.

## What you see for each candidate

Each rule match includes:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Human-readable name, such as “Rust target directory” |
| Category | Group such as `build-cache`, `package-cache`, or `downloads` |
| Confidence | `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` |
| Reason | Why the path is considered a cleanup candidate |
| Risk note | What may break, slow down, or require a download afterward |
| Default selection | Whether the rule asks to preselect the item |

When multiple rules match one entry, Cleanr chooses the best hit using trust,
default selection, and confidence. The final plan removes overlapping parent
and child candidates so space is not counted twice.

## Confidence is not a guarantee

| Level | How to treat it |
| --- | --- |
| `High` | Usually generated or downloadable data; still review unfamiliar paths |
| `Medium` | Often rebuildable, but may be expensive or contain local-only state |
| `Low` | May be user data and always needs careful manual review |

Only a `High` confidence rule with `default_selected = true` from a built-in or
trusted source can preselect an item.

## Built-in rule packs

### `builtin-dev`

The built-in plugin manifest `cleanr.builtin.dev` provides the `builtin-dev`
rule pack. In addition to known package-manager and tool caches, the pack uses
project-aware rules for generated project artifacts. These rules first identify
a project root from marker files, optionally constrained by its direct child
directories, then match only declared, exact paths relative to that root. A
directory name alone is not enough to identify one of these project artifacts.

Project-aware coverage includes:

- Cargo, Node.js and React Native, Unity, Haskell, SBT, Maven, Gradle, CMake,
  and Unreal Engine;
- Jupyter, Python, Pixi, Composer, Pub, Flutter, Elixir, Swift, Zig, Godot,
  and .NET;
- Turborepo, Terraform, and CocoaPods.

The pack also retains rules for caches such as Cargo registries and Git
dependencies, npm, pnpm, Yarn, pip, uv, Go modules, Xcode `DerivedData`, and
Next.js and Python tool caches. Python `.venv` directories are intentionally not
covered: they may contain local environments that are costly or impossible to
reproduce exactly. Other higher-risk or potentially locally stateful
directories are review-only and are never preselected; read their reason and
risk note before including them in a cleanup plan.

### `builtin-general`

Finds broader candidates that should be reviewed manually:

- files of at least 100 MiB under a Downloads directory;
- `.log` files of at least 50 MiB;
- `.tmp` files of at least 1 MiB.

These rules are intentionally medium or low confidence and start unselected.

### `builtin-system`

Finds known user-level system cleanup candidates:

- browser cache directories for common browsers;
- application cache directories;
- large temporary files, logs, and Downloads files.

Only high-confidence browser cache directories are preselected. Application
caches, temporary files, logs, and Downloads are review-only by default.

## Enable or disable packs

Only IDs in `cleanup.enabled_rule_packs` are loaded:

```toml
[cleanup]
enabled_rule_packs = ["builtin-dev", "builtin-general", "builtin-system"]
```

Removing `builtin-general` and `builtin-system` is useful when you want Cleanr
to focus only on developer caches.

Run `/rules` inside the TUI to inspect the active packs and rules.

## Add custom rules

The recommended format is a declarative plugin bundle. See
[Plugins](./plugins) for a complete minimal example, validation commands, and
the trust model.

For generated paths that are meaningful only inside a particular project, use
a project matcher instead of a broad directory-name or path glob. Positive
marker and root-directory globs identify the project root, excluded globs veto
ambiguous roots, and `artifact_paths` lists the exact relative directories that
may match:

```toml
[rules.match]
kind = "directory"

[rules.match.project]
marker_globs = ["acme-project.toml"]
root_dir_globs = ["src"]
excluded_marker_globs = ["acme-keep-build"]
excluded_root_dir_globs = ["keep-output"]
artifact_paths = ["build/cache", "build/generated"]
```

This fragment belongs to a `[[rules]]` entry. Keep the usual confidence,
default-selection, reason, and risk fields conservative, especially when an
artifact may require network access or contain local-only state. Excluded globs
only veto children observed in the same scan snapshot; an ignored path is not
proof that a child does not exist, so never use an exclusion as the rule's only
safety boundary. When publishing a bundle that uses this matcher, set its
`cleanr_version` to the first Cleanr release whose rule schema supports
`project`; do not reuse the generic `>=0.1.0` minimum from the minimal example.

Legacy loose TOML rule-pack files are still discovered in plugin directories,
but bundles provide version and compatibility metadata and are preferred.
