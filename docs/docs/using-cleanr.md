# Using Cleanr

## Choose what to scan

The paths passed at startup become the default scan roots:

```bash
cleanr ~/projects/app-one ~/projects/app-two
```

If no path is provided, the current directory is used. Starting Cleanr does not
immediately scan those paths; press `s` or run `/scan`.

You can replace the current roots from the command palette:

```text
/scan /home/me/projects/app-one /home/me/Downloads
```

Add `--global` to scan known system cleanup locations in addition to any paths
you provide:

```text
/scan /home/me/projects --global
```

From the command palette, press `/`, type `global`, and press `Enter` to select
the `/scan --global` shortcut without remembering the flag.

Use `--global-kind` to narrow the global preset. Passing a kind automatically
enables global scanning:

```text
/scan --global-kind browser-caches
```

Paths typed inside the TUI are not expanded by a shell, so `~` and environment
variables remain literal text. Use absolute paths. For paths containing spaces,
pass the quoted path when launching Cleanr instead.

## Review and select candidates

After a scan, press `r` or run `/review`. The review view shows the candidate
path, size, confidence, reason, and risk note.

High-confidence items from built-in or trusted rules can be preselected.
Medium- and low-confidence items, and all matches from untrusted plugins, start
unselected.

Useful keys while reviewing:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k`, `↓` / `↑` | Move through the list |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to the first / last item |
| `space` or `Enter` | Select or deselect the current item |
| `a` or `%` | Select or deselect all items |
| `i` | Explain the selected path |
| `c` | Continue to cleanup confirmation |
| `h` or `Esc` | Return home |
| `?` | Open keyboard help |
| `q` | Quit |

Numeric prefixes work with list movement. For example, `5j` moves down five
items and `12G` jumps to item 12.

## Clean selected items

Press `c` or run `/clean` to review the selected count and size. With the
default configuration, Cleanr asks for confirmation and initially selects
**No**.

After confirmation, each selected item is validated again and moved to the
system trash. Failures are recorded per item; one failed item does not hide
the result of the others.

`/clean --confirm` skips the confirmation dialog and executes the current
selection as an explicit local user action. Use it only after reviewing the
plan.

## Restore a cleanup run

Run `/restore`, select a cleanup run, and press `Enter`. Confirm the restore to
move available items back to their original paths.

Restore can fail when:

- an item has already been removed from the system trash;
- another file or directory now exists at the original path;
- the operating system cannot identify the original trash item;
- the platform does not support programmatic restore.

Cleanr never overwrites an existing restore target.

## Non-interactive commands

Use these commands from scripts or terminals when you do not need the TUI:

```bash
cleanr scan --json /path/to/project
cleanr plan --output cleanr-plan.json /path/to/project
cleanr dry-run --json /path/to/project
cleanr restore list
cleanr restore run <run-id> --confirm
```

`dry-run` and `plan` only generate a cleanup plan. They do not move files.
Restore still requires `--confirm`.

## Slash commands

Press `/` to open the command palette. Commands that need scan results appear
after a scan finishes.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/scan [path...] [--global] [--global-kind=<kind>]` | Scan paths or known system cleanup locations |
| `/scan --global` | Scan all known system cleanup locations |
| `/usage [path...] [--global] [--global-kind=<kind>]` | Scan and open the disk-usage summary |
| `/usage --global` | Scan known system cleanup locations and open usage |
| `/review` | Build and show cleanup candidates |
| `/plan` | Build the current cleanup plan |
| `/clean` | Review the current selection and request confirmation |
| `/clean --confirm` | Execute the current selection without the dialog |
| `/export-plan [path]` | Write the plan as JSON; defaults to `cleanr-plan.json` |
| `/restore` | Open cleanup history and restore a run |
| `/rules` | Show active rule packs and rules |
| `/plugins` | Show loaded declarative plugins |
| `/languages` | Show and switch installed languages |
| `/tasks` | Show task activity from the current session |
| `/help` | Open keyboard help |
| `/quit` | Quit Cleanr |

`/stats` is an alias for `/usage`, `/lang` for `/languages`, and `/q` for
`/quit`.

## Inspect disk usage without cleaning

Press `u` or run `/usage`. This performs a scan and opens a size-oriented view.
It does not move files or automatically execute a cleanup plan.

## Cancel or leave safely

- During a scan, press `Esc` or `x` to request cancellation.
- Outside a scan, `Esc` or `h` returns home.
- `q` or `Ctrl+C` exits Cleanr and restores the terminal.
